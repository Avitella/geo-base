# Reverse geocoding library

GeoBase is a immutable storage of geographical data (data generated by
GeoBaseGenerate and stored on disk in special format).
GeoBase uses memory mapping of data file for fast initialization and
optimal using of RAM. You do not pay for geographical polygons that are
not requested.

## Quick start

```c++
#include <exception>
#include <iostream>

#include <geo_base/geo_base.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  if (argc != 2) {
    std::cerr << "USAGE: quick-start <geodata.dat>";
    return -1;
  }

  geo_base::GeoBasePtr geo_base = NULL;
  try {
    geo_base = geo_base::GeoBasePtr(new geo_base::GeoBase(argv[1]));
  } catch (const std::exception& e) {
    std::cerr << "EXCEPTION: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    return -1;
  }

  geo_base::Location location;
  while (std::cin >> location) {
    geo_base::RegionID region_id = geo_base->Lookup(location);
    if (region_id != geo_base::kUnknownRegionID) {
      std::cerr << region_id << std::endl;
    } else {
      std::cerr << -1 << std::endl;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```
